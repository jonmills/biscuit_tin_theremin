As both sensors are on the same bus, they need to be configured separately so
that their IDs don't clash. Configure devices as 0x70 and 0x71. Need to cycle
the power following device ID reconfig before new device ID becomes active.

There is an Arduino STF02 interface library on the web at:

First channel is amplitude. Second channel is frequency.
